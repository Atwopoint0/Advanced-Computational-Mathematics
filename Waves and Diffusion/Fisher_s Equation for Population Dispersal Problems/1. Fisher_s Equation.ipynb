The expansion of a population which is initially limited to a finite spatial range is considered. Thus solutions are required subject to the following boundary conditions:\n","\\begin{align}\n","    \\rho(x, 0) &=\n","    \\begin{cases}\n","        \\rho_0(x) & 0 \\leq x \\leq 1, \\\\\n","        0 & x > 1,\n","    \\end{cases}\n","    \\\\\n","    \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}(0, t) &= 0 \\qquad t > 0, \\\\\n","    \\rho(x, t) &\\to 0 \\qquad \\text{as} \\quad x \\to \\infty.\n","\\end{align}\n","The form of the initial data leads us to consider a solution which is piecewise continuous with a single jump across $x = s(t)$, where conditions given by conservation laws must be satisfied.\n","\n","The initial boundary-value problem can now be reformulated as follows: For $0\\ \\leq x \\leq s(t)$,\n","\\begin{align}\n","    &\\rho t = (\\rho\\rho_x)_x + \\rho(1 - \\rho), \\\\\n","    &\\rho(x, 0) = \\rho_0(x), \\\\\n","    &\\rho_x(0, t) = 0, \\\\\n","    &\\rho(s(t), t) = 0, \\quad \\rho_x(s(t), t) = -\\dot{s}(t). \\\\\n","\\end{align}\n","While for $s(t) < x$, we require $\\rho(x, t) \\equiv 0$.
