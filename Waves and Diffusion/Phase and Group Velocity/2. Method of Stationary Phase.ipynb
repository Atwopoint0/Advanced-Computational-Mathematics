Neither analytic form is particularly suitable for calculating $u(x, t)$ at a large number of points. The Fourier representation is convenient in allowing a simple approximation for large $t$ to be obtained by the method of stationary phase.\n","\n","The method of stationary phase is an asymptotic technique used to approximate the value of integrals of the form\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    I(t) = \\int_{[a.b]} g(k)e^{it\\phi(k)}\\,dk\n","\\end{equation}\n","for large values of $t$ where the exponential term oscillates rapidly. These oscillations tend to cause destructive interference, meaning the contributions from different points $k$ to the total value of the integral cancel each other out. However, this cancellation is less effective near points $k_0$ where the phase is \"stationary, i.e., where the derivative $\\phi'$ is zero. The main contribution to the integral, comes from the small neighborhoods around these stationary points.\n","\n","To approximate the integral, the phase $\\phi(k)$ is expanded as a Taylor series around the stationary point $k_0$ up to the second order, and the amplitude $g(k)$ is approximated by its value at $k_0$. This transforms the integral into a Fresnel integral, which has a known solution. The resulting approximation around a single stationary point $k_0$ inside the integration interval is\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    I(t) \\approx g(k_0)\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{t|\\phi''(k_0)|}} e^{i(t\\phi(k_0) \\pm \\pi/4)}.\n","\\end{equation}\n","The sign in the exponent depends on the sign of the second derivative $\\phi''(k_0)$.\n","\n","The solution $u(x,t)$ can be expressed as the real part of an integral in the standard form for the stationary phase method.

The stationary points satisfy\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    \\phi'(k_0) = V - \\Omega'(k_0) = 0,\n","\\end{equation}\n","or $\\Omega'(K_0) = V$. The second derivative of the phase is $\\phi''(k) = -\\Omega''(k)$.

This is the group velocity, which represents the speed at which the overall envelope or energy of a wave packet propagates. The stationary phase condition means that after a long time $t$, the main contribution to the wave at position $x$ comes from the wave component that has traveled with the group velocity $V$ to reach that point. Thus, the group velocity is the velocity of energy and information propagation for the wave."],"metadata":{"id":"kVD22QLj3kU5"}}]}
