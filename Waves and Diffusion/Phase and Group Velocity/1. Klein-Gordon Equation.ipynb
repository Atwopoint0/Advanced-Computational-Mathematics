For a simple sinusoidal wave, it can be expressed as the ratio of the wavelength to the time period or, more generally, as the ratio of the angular frequency to the angular wave number.\n","\n","The phase velocity describes the speed of a single frequency component of a wave. If you were to follow a single crest of a simple wave, its speed would be the phase velocity. Crucially, phase velocity does not represent the speed at which information or energy is transmitted. This role is fulfilled by the group velocity, which describes the speed of the overall shape or envelope of a wave packet.\n","\n","Under certain conditions, the phase velocity can exceed the speed of light in a vacuum. This does not violate the theory of relativity because no information or energy is being transferred faster than $c$.\n","\n","In a non-dispersive medium, all frequency components of a wave travel at the same speed, meaning the phase velocity equals the group velocity. However, in a dispersive medium, the phase velocity depends on the frequency, causing different components of the wave to travel at different speeds. This causes a wave packet to spread out over time."],"metadata":{"id":"TlDotIskoZSV"}}]}
