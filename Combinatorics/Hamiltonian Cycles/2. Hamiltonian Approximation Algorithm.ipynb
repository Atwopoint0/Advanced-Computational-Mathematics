In this graph, the Hamiltonian cycles are abundant. A well-known result in random graph theory is that for any fixed $p > 0$, a graph $\\mathcal{G}(n, p)$ will almost surely have a Hamiltonian cycle as $n$ tends to infinity.\n","\n","The approximation algorithm is highly effective. Because there are so many edges, the algorithm's path will rarely get stuck. At almost every step, the last vertex of the path will have numerous neighbors that are not yet in the path. This means the path will grow linearly.\n","\n","The dominant operation will be step 2. The algorithm will likely proceed $n - 1$ times in a row, extending the path one vertex at a time until it has length $n - 1$. The \"rotation\" step will rarely be needed, so we are likely to find a cycle in just over $n$ steps.\n","\n","To and account for somerandomness, a slightly more generous stopping time is desirable. A good choice for $T$ in this case would be a low-degree polynomial in $n$, where the dependency on $p$ is minimal. Crucially, because the graph is so dense, the stopping time does not need a strong dependency on $p$.\n","\n","The actual running time of the algorithm is highly dependent on $p$, as $p$ dictates the graph's structure.\n","\n","*   For low $p$, the graph is sparse, likely disconnected and almost certainly contains vertices of degree $0$ or $1$. The algorithm starts a path but gets stuck almost immediately. It cannot extend the path, and it cannot rotate it because the endpoint has no other neighbors. The algorithm will run for the full $T$ iterations where the stopping time is reached and fail.\n","\n","*   For $p$ near the threshold, the graph is likely connected but sparse, with a tree-like structure. It may have a minimum degree of $2$ but contains many \"split-vertices\" and few paths. The algorithm can build long paths, but it gets stuck frequently. It will then need to perform many rotation operations to try to reconfigure the path. The running time is the slowest of all cases.\n","\n","*   For high $p$, the graph is dense and highly connected and contains many redundant paths and numerous Hamiltonian cycles. The algorithm extends the path rapidly at almost every step and rotations are rarely needed. Hence, a cycle is found very quickly leading to the algorithm terminating in approximately $n$ steps."],"metadata":{"id":"cDCKGmd4m_QS"}}]}
