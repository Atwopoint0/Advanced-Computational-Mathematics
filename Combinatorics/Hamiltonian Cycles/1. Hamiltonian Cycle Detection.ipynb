This typically happens with graphs that have many paths that are \"almost\" Hamiltonian cycles, forcing the algorithm to go deep into its search before backtracking. An example of a worst-case graph is a complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n","\n","We fix the starting vertex $0$. From the starting vertex, there are $n-1$ possible choices for the next vertex in the path. From the second vertex, there are $n-2$ remaining choices. This continues until the last vertex, where there is only 1 choice left. The total number of permutations of vertices to check is $(n-1)!$.\n","\n","For each permutation, the algorithm performs a constant number of operations of order $O(n)$ (checking for an edge, checking if a vertex has been visited).\n","Therefore, the total complexity of a worst-case running time of is factorial $O(n!)$.\n","\n","The average-case running time depends heavily on the structure of the graph, particularly its density.\n","\n","*   In a sparse graph, most vertices have a low degree. The backtracking algorithm will quickly discover that it cannot extend the current path because there are no available unvisited neighbors. This leads to frequent and early backtracking. As a result, the search tree is pruned very effectively, and the running time is much better than the worst case. The algorithm will likely not explore many full-length paths.\n","\n","*   In a dense graph, the high number of edges means that a Hamiltonian cycle is very likely to exist. The algorithm will still explore many paths, but it is likely to find a valid cycle relatively quickly without needing to exhaust the entire search space. The expected running time is therefore better than the worst case because the search is often successful long before all possibilities are checked.\n","\n","*   The most challenging cases lie in a transition region, where the probability $p$ is just around the threshold for a Hamiltonian cycle to appear (which for large $n$ is around $p = (\\log(n) + \\log\\log(n)) / n$. The graphs might have many long paths but no complete cycle, forcing the algorithm to do a significant amount of work. This should still be empirically much faster than $O(n!)$ for most random graphs as the number of paths that need to be explored is a tiny fraction of the $(n-1)!$ total possibilities."],"metadata":{"id":"N6wr96spEFjm"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Parameters\n","MAX_N = 12\n","N_VALUES = range(5, MAX_N + 1)\n","NUM_SAMPLES = 20  #
