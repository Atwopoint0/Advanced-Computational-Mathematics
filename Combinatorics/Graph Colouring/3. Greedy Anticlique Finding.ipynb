This is because it takes a more global view at each step, trying to \"satisfy\" as many vertices as possible with a single colour.\n","\n","As the edge probability p increases, the graph becomes denser. Both methods use more colours, which is expected as ddenser graphs have smaller independent sets and larger cliques, making them harder to colour. The independent set method continues to provide a better upper bound (fewer colours) than the simple greedy heuristics across all tested probabilities.\n","\n","The performance gap is stable. The difference between the two methods stays roughly the same (around 1-2 colours).

Repeated greedy clique-finding procedure\n","\n","    This procedure runs a simple greedy search n times, once starting from each vertex in the graph. A single greedy search starts with one vertex.

Independent set-finding procedure\n","\n","    This procedure leverages the clique-finder.

The loop continues until the graph is empty.\n","\n","    The number of iterations is the number of colours used which we denote as $C$, typically on the order of $O(n/\\log n)$. Each iteration calls the independent set-finding proceedure, which takes $O(n'^2 \\log n')$ time, where $n'$ is the number of vertices remaining.
