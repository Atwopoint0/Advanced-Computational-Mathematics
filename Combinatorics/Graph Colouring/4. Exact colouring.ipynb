No known algorithm can solve it in polynomial time. The standard method is a recursive backtracking algorithm that tries all possibilities in a structured way.\n","\n","We can try $k$-colouring by checking for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$ until we find the first $k$ that works. Define a function can_k_colour(graph, k, vertex_colours) as follows:\n","\n","*   Base case: If all vertices have been assigned a colour, return True\n","*   Recursive Step:\n","    *   Select an uncoloured vertex $v$.\n","    *   Iterate through each colour $c$ from $1$ to $k$.\n","    *   For each colour $c$, check if it's a valid choice for $v$.\n","    *   If $c$ is a valid colour for $v$:\n","        *   Assign colour($v$) = $c$.\n","        *   Make a recursive call: can_k_colour(graph, k, updated_vertex_colours).\n","        *   If the recursive call returns True, it means a solution was found down that path, so return True immediately.\n","        *   If the call returns False, backtrack: undo the assignment of $c$ to $v$ and try the next colour in the loop.\n","*   Failure: If the loop over all $k$ colours finishes without any of them leading to a solution, it means $v$ cannot be coloured. Return False.\n","\n","Call this function for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots, n$. The first value of $k$ for which can_k_colour returns True is the chromatic number. This algorithm essentially explores a search tree. At each of the $n$ vertices, it tries up to $k$ different colours.\n","\n","In the worst case, the algorithm might have to explore a large fraction of the $k^n$ possible ways to assign $k$ colours to $n$ vertices. For each assignment, checking its validity takes polynomial time. The backtracking prunes the search, but the worst-case time complexity remains exponential.\n","\n","The running time is crudely estimated as $O(k^n n^2)$, where $k$ is the chromatic number. This is an exponential-time algorithm and is only feasible for very small graphs."],"metadata":{"id":"nq6rAwgCKAWM"}}]}
