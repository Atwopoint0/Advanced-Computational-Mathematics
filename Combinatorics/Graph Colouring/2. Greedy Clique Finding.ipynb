Notice that $\\chi(G)$ is at least as large as the order of a clique denoted $\\omega(G)$.\n","\n","A greedy-type algorithm for finding a complete subgraph in G would start with a subgraph of order one (a vertex) and repeatedly try to find a vertex joined to all vertices of the subgraph selected so far, until no further such vertex could be found."],"metadata":{"id":"mdIWLibB71iA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The greedy algorithm for finding a clique is myopic. It makes locally optimal choices without any foresight, which can lead it down a path that terminates prematurely.  \n","\n","We can argue that it is unlikely to find a clique of order $14$ in a graph from $\\mathcal{G}(2000, 0.5)$ by looking at the probability of being able to extend a clique at each step. Let's assume the algorithm has successfully found a clique of order $k$. To extend this to a clique of order $k+1$, it must find a vertex, from the remaining $n-k$ vertices, that is connected to all $k$ vertices already in the clique.\n","\n","The probability that a specific vertex is connected to all $k$ vertices of the existing clique is $0.5^k$ by independence. The expected number of vertices that can extend the clique of size $k$ is given by the formula\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    E = (2000 - k)(0.5)^k.\n","\\end{equation}\n","If the algorithm has a clique of size 13, then the expected number of suitable vertices is $(2000 - 13)(0.5)^{13} = 1987 / 8192 \\approx 0.24$. Also, note that once the algorithm has found a clique of size $11$, the expected number of vertices that can extend it drops below $1$.\n","\n","Therefore, for the greedy algorithm to reach a clique of size 14, it would need to succeed against diminishing odds multiple times in a row. For a typical run starting from a random vertex, the algorithm will almost certainly terminate with a clique of size around $11$ or $12$, making it extremely unlikely to ever find one of order $14$."],"metadata":{"id":"mQFnCL4U8r5z"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["While the greedy algorithm performs poorly, the actual largest clique in a $\\mathcal{G}(2000, 0.5)$ graph is likely to be significantly larger. We can estimate this size by finding the value of $k$ for which we expect to find approximately one clique of that size in the entire graph.\n","\n","The expected number of k-cliques is given by\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    E[X_k] = C(n, k) p^{(k(k-1)/2)},\n","\\end{equation}\n","where $C(n, k)$ is the number of ways to choose $k$ vertices from $n$.
