This is where,\n","for each vertex in $X$ or $Y$, we create a list of its neighbours.\n","\n","Using an adjacency matrix:\n","*   Main loop: The algorithm starts with an empty matching and increases its size by one with each successful augmentation. Since a 1-factor has size $n$, this main loop will run at most $n$ times. This gives a factor of $O(n)$.\n","*   Finding an augmenting path by BFS:  A standard BFS visits each vertex and each edge once.  When using an adjacency matrix, to find the neighbors of a single vertex $u$ from the set $X$, we must iterate through the entire corresponding row of the matrix, which takes $O(n)$ time. Our graph has $2n$ vertices, so total work for one BFS is $O(n^2)$.\n","*   Total Complexity: Combining the two parts, the total complexity is the number of augmentations multiplied by the cost of finding each path which is $O(n^3)$.\n","\n","With an adjacency list, finding the neighbors of a vertex $u$ only requires time proportional to the degree of that vertex, $\\deg(u)$. A standard BFS on a graph with $V$ vertices and $m$ edges has a complexity of $O(V + m)$. In our case, $V = 2n = O(n)$ and $m > n-1$ for a connected graph, so the complexity of one search becomes $O(n + m) = O(m)$. The main loop still runs $O(n)$ times, so the total complexity would be $O(nm)$.\n","\n","If the graph is dense, then the number of edges m is on the order of $n^2$  so the adjacency list complexity becomes $O(n^3)$, which is asymptotically the same as the adjacency matrix version. If the graph is sparse, the number of edges m is much smaller, often on the order of $O(n)$. In this case, the adjacency list complexity becomes $O(n²)$.\n","\n","Using an adjacency list would provide a significant performance improvement for sparse graphs, reducing the complexity from cubic to quadratic. For dense graphs, there would be no asymptotic benefit, though it might still be faster in practice due to lower constant factors.\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xWzPQnAkzIel"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The alternating path method for finding a $1$-factor is not directly effective for graphs that are not bipartite, despite Hall's criterion still holding.\n","\n","In a bipartite graph, all cycles are of even length, which simplifies the search for alternating paths. The vertices can be neatly layered into sets that are reached by non-matching edges and sets that are reached by matching edges.\n","\n","The primary reason the simple alternating path algorithm fails in general graphs is the presence of odd-length cycles. A blossom is an odd-length cycle where the vertices are connected by alternating matched and unmatched edges, with the exception of one \"base\" vertex where two unmatched edges in the cycle are incident. If a simple augmenting path search enters a blossom, it can get trapped or fail to identify a true augmenting path that may exist.\n","\n","A solution is the Blossom Algorithm. It handles odd cycles by:\n","*   Identifying a blossom: When the search for an augmenting path identifies an odd cycle, it recognizes this structure.\n","*   Contracting the blossom: The algorithm then \"shrinks\" or contracts the entire blossom into a single \"pseudo-vertex.\" The search for an augmenting path continues in this new, smaller graph.\n","*   Lifting the path: If an augmenting path is found in the contracted graph, it is then \"lifted\" or expanded back to the original graph.\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5rydG3ubNpQP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The current algorithm is designed to stop as soon as it determines a $1$-factor is impossible.
