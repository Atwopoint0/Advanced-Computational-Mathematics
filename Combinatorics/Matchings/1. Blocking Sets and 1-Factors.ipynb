A $1$-factor in a graph is a $1$-regular spanning subgraph, or, in other words, a matching meeting every vertex. A $1$-factor in an $n \\times n$ bipartite graph is a matching of size $n$.\n","\n","Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with vertex classes $X$ and $Y$ , where $|X| = |Y| = n$. If $A$ is a subset of $X$, then its neighbourhood $\\Gamma(A)$ is the set of vertices in $Y$ joined to at least one member of $A$. A set $A \\subseteq X$ is called a blocking set if $|\\Gamma(A)| < |A|$. Hall's theorem tells us that $G$ has a 1-factor if and only if $G$ has no blocking set.\n","\n","A brute force algorithm to check for a $1$-factor to to examine every subset $A$ of the vertex class $X$ and check if its a blocking set. This approach has an exponential time complexity, as for a vertex class $X$ with $n$ vertices, the total number of possible subsets is $2^n$. This leads to an exponential time complexity, making this algorithm infeasible and potentially numerically unstable for larger graphs."],"metadata":{"id":"23yoleQKsnPG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Our algorithm to find a $1$-factor will consist of finding successively larger matchings, starting with the empty matching. Let $M$ be a matching meeting the sets of vertices $A \\subseteq X$ and $B \\subseteq Y$.\n","\n","Let $u \\in X-A$. An alternating path is a path from $u$ to a vertex $v \\in Y$, such that every second edge is in $M$. We say that $v$ is reachable from $u$ by an alternating path; let $V$ be the subset of $Y$ consisting of vertices reachable from $u$.\n","\n","We first show that a matching larger than $M$ be found if $V \\not\\subset B$.\n","\n","If the set of reachable vertices via an alternating path $V \\subset Y$ is not a subset of $B$ (the matched vertices in $Y$), then we can find a vertex $v \\in V$ with $v \\notin B$.\n","There is an alternating path $P$ that starts at the unmatched vertex $u \\in X$ and ends at an unmatched vertex $v \\in Y$, known as an augmenting path.\n","\n","A larger matching $M'$ can be created by taking the symmetric difference of the current matching $M$ and the set of edges in the augmenting path $P$.\n","*   Edges in $P$ that were not in $M$ are added to $M'$.\n","*   Edges in $P$ that were in $M$ are removed from $M'$.\n","Since an augmenting path always begins and ends with an edge not in the original matching, this process results in a new valid matching $M'$ that contains exactly one more edge than $M$.\n","\n","Secondly, we can show that a blocking set be found if $V \\subseteq B$.\n","\n","If $V \\subset B$, then it means that every vertex in $Y$ reachable from the unmatched vertex $u$ via an alternating path is already part of the matching $M$ and no augmenting path starting from $u$ exists. Let $S \\subset X$ be the set of all vertices reachable from $u$ by an alternating path. By definition, $\\Gamma(S) = V$.\n","\n","Every vertex $y \\in V$ is matched to a vertex $x \\in X$ by an edge in $M$. As $y$ is reachable from $u$, its matched partner $x$ must also be reachable from $u$ (by extending the alternating path to $y$ with the matched edge). Therefore, all vertices in $X$ matched with vertices in $V$ are contained within $S$, hence $|V| \\leq |S|$. The set $S$ contains the initial unmatched vertex $u$ together with all the vertices in $X$ that are matched with the vertices in $V$, implying $|S| = |V| + 1$. Since $|Γ(S)| < |S|$, the set $S$ is a blocking set."],"metadata":{"id":"yt2NGHidbRuT"}}]}
