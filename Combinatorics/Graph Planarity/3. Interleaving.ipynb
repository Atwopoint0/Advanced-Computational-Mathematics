Additionally, $B'$ and $B'$ are also said to interleave if they both have exactly three vertices of attachment, these three vertices being the same for $B'$ as for $B'$.\n","\n","If C has $\\ell$ bridges $B_1, \\dots, B_{\\ell}$, then the interleave graph $H$ has $\\ell$ vertices $h_1, \\dots, h_{\\ell}$, with $h_ih_j \\in E(H)$ if and only if $B_i$ and $B_j$ interleave.\n","\n","Suppose $G$ is a graph with a cycle $C$ that has $\\ell$ bridges $B_1, \\dots, B_{\\ell}$. Then $G$ is planar if and only if the following holds:\n","*   Each of the subgraphs with edges $E(C) \\cup B_i$, $1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell$, is planar.\n","*   The interleave graph $H$ is bipartite.\n","\n","We shall give a full proof of this.\n","\n","Assume we have a planar drawing of $G$. Then clearly, if the entire graph $G$ can be drawn without any edges crossing, then any subgraph can also be drawn without crossings.\n","\n","By the Jordan curve theorem, the cycle $C$ forms a closed loop that divides the plane into two distinct regions. Every bridge of $C$ must be drawn almost entirely in one of these two regions, except for its attachment points on C. For two bridges that interleave, by definition their attachment points on the cycle alternate. Hence, one must lie on the outside of $C$ and the other on the inside of $C$ to avoid a crossing. This creates two disjoint sets of bridges whereby an edge in the interleave graph $H$ only exists between bridges on different sides of $C$. This is precisely the definition of a bipartite graph.\n","\n","Now assume that both conditions hold. Since the interleave graph $H$ is bipartite, we can partition all the bridges of $G$ into two sets $A$ and $B$, such that no two bridges within the same set interleave.\n","\n","First, draw the cycle $C$ homeomorphic to a circle on the plane. Take all the bridges from $A$ and draw them entirely on the inside of the circle. Take all the bridges from $B$ and draw them entirely on the outside of the circle.\n","\n","By assumption, each individual bridge can be drawn planarly with the cycle. Furthermore, no two bridges drawn on the same side will cross each other, as all bridges inside $A$ (or $B$) do not interleave with each other. Finally, an inside bridge and an outside bridge cannot cross because they are separated by the cycle $C$."],"metadata":{"id":"p8CyU17PmA75"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import networkx as nx\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from collections import deque\n","from itertools import combinations\n","\n","def find_graph_components(graph):\n","    all_components = []\n","    visited_nodes = set()\n","    for node in graph.nodes():\n","        if node not in visited_nodes:\n","            current_component = []\n","            q = deque([node])\n","            visited_nodes.add(node)\n","            while q:\n","                current_node = q.popleft()\n","                current_component.append(current_node)\n","                for neighbor in graph.neighbors(current_node):\n","                    if neighbor not in visited_nodes:\n","                        visited_nodes.add(neighbor)\n","                        q.append(neighbor)\n","            all_components.append(current_component)\n","    return all_components\n","\n","def find_bridges_of_cycle(graph, cycle_nodes):\n","    bridges = []\n","    cycle_nodes_set = set(cycle_nodes)\n","    cycle_edges = {tuple(sorted((cycle_nodes[i], cycle_nodes[(i + 1) % len(cycle_nodes)]))) for i in range(len(cycle_nodes))}\n","\n","    #
