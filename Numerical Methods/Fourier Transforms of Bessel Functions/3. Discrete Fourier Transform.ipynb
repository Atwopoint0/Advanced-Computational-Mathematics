If $\\Delta x$ is too large, we fail to capture the high-frequency oscillations of the function $F(x)$ or the complex exponential $\\exp(-2\\pi ikx)$.\n","\n","*   In particular, the approximation fails when $|k| ≳ 1/(2\\Delta x)$. This is the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Taking $\\Delta x \\to 0$ pushes the maximum wavenumber limit $1/(2\\Delta x)$ to infinity, meaning we can accurately represent the transform for any $k$. Failing to do this causes high frequencies to be misrepresented as low frequencies, a phenomenon known as aliasing.\n","\n","\n","Condition 2: The sampling range must tend to infinity (No spectral leakage).\n","*   Limit: $\\Delta k \\to 0$, i.e. $X \\to \\infty$.\n","\n","*   The true Fourier Transform integrates over an infinite domain $(-\\infty, +\\infty)$. Our approximation is based on observing $F(x)$ only over a finite window $[0, X]$. If $F(x)$ has significant values outside this window, our approximation will be inaccurate.\n","\n","*   Truncating $F(x)$ is equivalent to multiplying the true function by a rectangular window function. In the frequency domain, this causes a convolution of the true spectrum $\\hat{F}(k)$ with a sinc function, which \"smears\" or \"leaks\" sharp spectral features across a wider frequency range. This phenomenon is called spectral leakage. To eliminate it, the window must be infinitely wide, so we must let $X \\to \\infty$.\n","\n","*   A secondary effect of this limit is that the wave number resolution, $\\Delta k = 1/X$, tends to zero. This means the discrete points where the DFT is calculated become more and more finely spaced, eventually forming a continuous function $\\hat{F}(k)$.\n","\n","\n","Condition 3: A suitable change of the origin.\n","\n","*   The FT is defined on a symmetric domain $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, while the DFT is defined on a one-sided domain $[0, N-1]$.\n","\n","*   For the DFT to properly approximate the FT of a function centered at $x=0$, we must redefine our sampling window to be symmetric, for example, $[-X/2, +X/2]$. An $N$-point DFT, however, computes the sum over indices $0, \\dots, N-1$.\n","\n","*   The standard practice is to sample the function $F(x)$ from $x = -X/2$ to $x = X/2 - \\Delta x$, and then feed these samples to the DFT algorithm in a \"shifted\" order: the samples corresponding to x in $[0, X/2 - \\Delta x]$ come first, followed by the samples for x in [-X/2, -\\Delta x].\n","\n","*   The DFT algorithm inherently treats its input as periodic, so this arrangement is mathematically equivalent. As we take the limits $X \\to \\infty$ and $N \\to \\infty$, this symmetric sampling window $[-X/2, X/2]$ expands to cover the entire real line $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, matching the domain of the Fourier Transform integral."],"metadata":{"id":"jp8SCI3npms0"}}]}
