Specifically, the DFT sum corresponds to the rectangle rule for numerical integration over the interval $[0, X]$, using $N$ intervals of width $\\Delta x$. The height of each rectangle is taken from the left endpoint of the interval, and the value at the final endpoint is ignored.\n","\n","The DFT also implicitly assumes that the function being transformed is periodic with period X, meaning $F(X) = F(0)$, or $F_n = F_0$.

However, if we are analyzing a function that is not periodic over the interval $[0, X]$, then $F_n \\neq F_0$. In this case, the rectangle rule used by the DFT is a poor approximation. The trapezium rule is generally superior, as it accounts for the function's value at both ends of the integration interval.\n","\n","The formula for the trapezium rule applied to I₁ (ignoring the complex exponential) is:\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    \\int F(x)\\,dx \\cong \\Delta x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}F_0 + F₁  + \\cdots + F_{n-1} + \\frac{1}{2}F_n \\right]\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","The sum computed by a standard DFT on the input vector $[F_0, \\dots, F_{n-1}]$ is $F_0 + \\cdots + F_{n-1}$.

To correct this, we can alter the input vector. If we replace the first element $F_0$ with the new value $\\frac{1}{2}(F_0 + F_n)$, then the new sum is exactly the sum of function values from the trapezium rule, improving the approximation of the integral $I_1$ for non-periodic functions."],"metadata":{"id":"zD2HAQRDiAZZ"}}]}
