The equation of a characteristic curve starting at $(x_0, 0)$ is given by integrating $\\frac{dx}{dt} = u$.

Compressive flow: $u_0(x) = \\mathbb{1}_{\\{x < 0\\}}$. For $x < 0$, the characteristic curves are lines with velocity $1$, while for $x > 0$, they are vertical lines ($x = x_0$) with velocity $u=0$. The faster moving curves from the left intersect the stationary characteristics on the right. They all intersect along the line $x = t$ for $t > 0$ forming a shock wave.\n","\n"," 2.

This means they are diverging, creating a wedge-shaped gap where no characteristic lines from the initial condition exist.\n","    \n","    This gap must be filled with a continuous solution known as a rarefaction wave or an expansion fan. This is a self-similar solution that depends only on the ratio $x/t$.
