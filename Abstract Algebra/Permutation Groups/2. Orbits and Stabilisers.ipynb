If $\\beta \\in X$ is in the orbit of $\\alpha$, then an element $g \\in G$ is called a witness of this if $g\\alpha = \\beta$. We can see that $\\beta$ is in the orbit of $\\alpha$ if and only if the orbit of $\\beta$ is the same as the orbit of $\\alpha$. Hence different orbits are disjoint form a partition of $X$.\n","\n","The stabilizer of an element $\\alpha$ in $X$ is\n","\\begin{equation}\n","G_\\alpha = \\{g \\in G : g\\alpha = \\alpha\\},\n","\\end{equation}\n","and it is a subgroup of $G$.\n","\n","Consider the set of all left cosets of $G_\\alpha$ in $G$\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    G/G_\\alpha = \\{ gG_\\alpha : g \\in G \\}.\n","\\end{equation}\n","Define a function $f: G/G_\\alpha \\to \\mathop{Orb}(\\alpha)$ via $f(gG_\\alpha) = g\\alpha$.\n","\n","*   The function is well-defined: If $g_1G_\\alpha = g_2G_\\alpha$ for $g_1, g_2 \\in G$, then $g_2^{-1}g_1 \\in G_\\alpha$. By the definition of the stabilizer $(g_2^{-1}g_1)\\alpha = \\alpha$. Applying g₂ to both sides, we get $g_1\\alpha = g_2\\alpha$, hence $f(g_1G_\\alpha) = f(g_2G\\alpha)$.\n","\n","*   The function is injective: Suppose that $f(g_1G_\\alpha) = f(g_2G_\\alpha)$. By definition, this means that $g_1\\alpha = g_2\\alpha$. Applying $g_2^{-1}$ to both sides gives $(g_2^{-1}g_1)\\alpha = \\alpha$. So $g_2^{-1}g_1 \\in G_\\alpha$ and the left coset $(g_2^{-1}g_1)G_\\alpha$ is equal to $G_\\alpha$.

The procedure is a breadth first search on a graph. The elements of the set $X = \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ are the nodes of the graph, and the generators of the group $G$ represent the edges.
