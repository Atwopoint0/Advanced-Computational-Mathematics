By definition of the stabiliser $(xt_1)\\alpha = \\alpha$\n","\n","Combining the results $t_{r+1}\\alpha = (xt_1)\\alpha = \\alpha$, this shows that $t_{r+1} \\in G_\\alpha$. By its definition, $t_{r+1} = \\phi(y_rt_r)$ is an element of the set of coset representatives $T$. Since $T$ is a complete set of representatives, it contains exactly one element for each coset. Both $t_1$ and $t_{r+1}$ are in $T$ and in $G_\\alpha$, so it follows by uniqueness they must be the same element.

Define the sequence $t_i$ with $t_1$ as the representative for $G_\\alpha$ and $t_{i+1} = \\phi(y_it_i)$. For each $i$, define a Schreier generator $s_i = \\phi(y_it_i)^{-1}y_it_i = t_{i+1}^{-1}y_it_i \\in $.
