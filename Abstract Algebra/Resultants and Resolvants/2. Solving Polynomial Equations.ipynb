The resultant will be a polynomial in $y$. Solving for the roots of this resultant polynomial gives the $y$-coordinates of the points where the two original equations intersect. We use an evaluation and interpolation method, taking advantage of the fact that a polynomial of degree $r$ is uniquely determined by any $r+1$ value.\n","\n","*   Establish a degree bound: The resultant of two polynomials $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ (with respect to $x$) is a polynomial in $y$.
