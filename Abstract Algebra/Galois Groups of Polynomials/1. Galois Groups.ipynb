Furthermore, it is isomorphic in a way which preserves cycle types, so the cycle type of the generator of the decomposition group will also occur in the Galois group.\n","\n","We shall use the decomposition groups to derive information about the Galois group of a polynomial $f$. For example, if $G(f)$ contains a 2-cycle, an $(n-1)$-cycle and an $n$-cycle, then it must be $S_n$. As the decomposition group is always cyclic, this information does not distinguish between groups with the same abelian subgroups, but computing a sufficient number of decomposition\n","groups will usually determine the cyclic subgroups and hence often determine $G(f)$, although there is always the possibility that our answer will be too small if we do not compute enough."],"metadata":{"id":"rnb0sBPcOegH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","---\n","\n","To find the decomposition group of $f$ modulo $p$, we need information about the factorisation of $f$ over $GF(p)$.
