Each telephone call occupies a certain amount of space on certain links. This space is occupied for the duration of the call. The links which comprise the national telephone network only have limited capacity, and when they are full we get a busy signal.\n","\n","Some interesting questions are:\n","*   What is the probability of a busy signal?\n","*   How does it depend on the volume of traffic?\n","*   Can we reduce this probability by strategies such as offering multiple routes for a call?\n","\n","Consider a single link with the capacity to carry $C$ simultaneous calls. Suppose that new calls arrive as a Poisson process of rate $\\nu$, that each call lasts for a duration which is exponential with mean $1$, and that all call durations are independent of each other and of the arrival process. If a new call arrives when the link is already carrying $C$ calls, then the new call is blocked. This system is known as the Erlang link.\n","\n","\n","A continuous-time Markov model can be established to analyse the Erlang link system. The state of the system at any given time $t$ can be represented by the number of calls currently in progress, denoted as $X(t)$. The state space of this model is the set of all possible numbers of simultaneous calls, which is 4\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, C\\}$, where $C$ is the maximum capacity.\n","\n","The system transitions between these states based on the arrival of new calls and the completion of existing calls.\n","*   Arrivals: New calls are stated to arrive as a Poisson process with a rate of $\\nu$. This means that from any state $i < C$, there can be a transition to state $i + 1$ with rate $\\nu$. When the system is at full capacity $i = C$, any new incoming calls are blocked, so there are no transitions to a higher state.\n","*   Departures: Each of the $i$ active calls has a duration that follows an exponential distribution with a mean of $1$. Specifically, the rate of a single call completing is 1, so for $i$ calls, the total departure rate is $i$. This results in a transition from state $i$ to state $i - 1$ at a rate of $i$.\n","\n","At equilibrium, the probability of being in any given state $i$ is constant over time. This is achieved when the rate of flow into a state equals the rate of flow out of that state. Let $\\pi_i$ represent the equilibrium probability of having $i$ calls in progress.
