In particular, important questions are whether or not there exists an infinite cluster of open edges; and if one does exist, how many infinite clusters there are. Clearly if $p = 0$ there is none and if $p = 1$ there is one open cluster $G$ itself.\n","\n","Let $V$, the set of nodes of the graph, consist of finite strings, as follows: $V$ contains the empty string \"\" (also known as Eve), and the three strings \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\" (also known as Eve's daughters), and also every string that is one of Eve's daughters followed by a finite sequence of \"1\"s and \"2\"s.\n","\n","Two nodes are connected by an edge if one can be obtained by appending one\n","digit to the other.

The number of open offspring for any single node follows a Binomial distribution $B(2, p)$. The expected number of open offspring for a node is $\\mu = 2p$.

In each subtree, the probability of finding such an isolated infinite cluster is a constant positive value. By the Borel-Cantelli lemma, this event will happen infinitely many times. Therefore, the graph breaks into infinitely many disjoint infinite open clusters.\n","\n","This model exhibits a property which is general to percolation models: there exists a critical probability $p_c$ such that for $p < p_c$ there is no infinite cluster and for $p > p_c$ we find at least one infinite cluster.
