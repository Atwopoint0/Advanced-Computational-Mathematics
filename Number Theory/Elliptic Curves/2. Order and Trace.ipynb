Note that we should avoid the inefficient brute-force search of all $p^2$ pairs $(x, y)$. Instead, we iterate through each possible value of $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$ and calculate the number of corresponding $y$ values that satisfy the curve's equation. The total number of points is the sum of these affine solutions plus the single point at infinity $O = [0, 1, 0]$.\n","\n","The Weierstrass equation is\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6,\n","\\end{equation}\n","which can be rewritten as a quadratic equation in $y$\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    y^2 + (a_1x + a_3)y - (x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6) = 0\n","\\end{equation}\n","The number of solutions for $y$ depends on the prime $p$.\n","\n","*   Case 1: $p > 2$.\n","We can complete the square for the $y$ terms,\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    (y + (a_1x + a_3) 2^{-1})^2 = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6 + ((a_1x + a_3)2^{-1})^2.\n","\\end{equation}\n","We are solving an equation of the form $Y^2 = v$. The number of solutions for $Y$ (and thus for $y$) is determined by whether $v$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This can be found using the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{v}{p}\\right)$ where the number of solutions is given by $1 + \\left(\\frac{v}{p}\\right)$. We sum this quantity for each $x$ from $0$ to $p-1$.\n","\n","*   Case 2: $p = 2$. In $\\mathbb{F}_2$, division by $2$ is undefined, so we handle this case separately.

If the RHS is also $0$, then we get two solutions $y=0$ and $y=1$. If the RHS is $1$, then the we get no solutions.\n","\n","The algorithm iterates through all $p$ possible values for $x$. For $p > 2$, inside the loop, the main cost is calculating the Legendre symbol, which is done via modular exponentiation in $O(\\log p)$ time. For $p = 2$, the loop runs a constant two times. The initial discriminant calculation is constant with respect to $p$. Therefore, the total time complexity of the method is $O(p \\log p)$, which is significantly more efficient than the naive $O(p^2)$ approach.\n","\n","We also output the trace $t_p := p + 1 - |E(\\mathbb{F}_p)|$.
