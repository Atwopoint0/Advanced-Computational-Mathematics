For a form to be reduced and ambiguous, its coefficients must satisfy one of three special conditions, $b = 0$, $b = a$ or $a = c$. There is a relationship between the reduced ambiguous forms and the factoriation of the discriminant $d$.\n","\n","*   Forms of type $(a, 0, c)$: These forms correspond directly to the ways that $-d/4$ can be written as a product of two coprime integers $a$ and $c$.\n","*   Forms of type $(a, a, c)$ and $(a, b, a)$: These forms are related to factorisations of $-d$. The coefficients $a$ or $b$ appear as factors of $d$.\n","\n","Let $k$ be the number of distinct prime factors of the discriminant $d$. Then the number of reduced ambiguous forms is $2^{k-1}$.\n","\n","We wish to find a non-trivial factor of a given composite integer $N$ given the theory of binary quadratic forms. We take a discriminant $d = -kN$, with $k$ a small positive integer, and attempt to construct ambiguous forms of discriminant $d$. We repeatedly pick a form at random and raise it to a suitable power in the class group.\n","\n","To perform this method we require knowledge of the class number $h(d)$. Our existing method works by exhaustive search by enumerating all possible reduced forms for a given discriminant $d$ by iterating through all possible coefficients $a$ an $b$, of which there are proportionally $\\sqrt{-d}$ of each, leading to a time complexity of $O(|d|)$. The magnitude of the discriminant $|d|$ is on the same order as the number we want to factor $N$, so the time complexity is $O(N)$. This is worse than trial division which is approximately $O(\\sqrt{N})$.\n","\n","Instead we fix a positive integer $B$ and assume that $h(d)$ is a product of prime powers less than $B$. We choose a form of discriminant $d$ at random by choosing a small value of $a$, and then solving for $b$ and $c$ if possible. Then we successively raise it to each odd prime power less than $B$. We then repeatedly square (efficiently) this form in the hope of finding an ambiguous form that factors $N$. If this method repeatedly fails we might increase the value of $B$ or change the value of $k$.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7ZhXnfnCg21k"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import math\n","\n","def

The inputs to this operation are the coefficients $(a, b, c)$ of reduced forms whose sizes are bounded by the discriminant $d = -kN$. Specifically, $a$ can be as large as $O(\\sqrt{|d|}) = O(\\sqrt{N})$.\n","\n","The composition operation relies on the extended Euclidean algorithm. The complexity on numbers of size $X$ is polynomial in the number of bits, roughly $O(\\log^2 X)$. Since our coefficients are up to $O(\\sqrt{N})$, this is $O(\\log N)$. Therefore, the time complexity of a single composition followed by a reduction is $O(\\log^2 N)$.\n","\n","The most computationally expensive part of the algorithm is raising the initial form $f$ to the large exponent $E$. The number of compositions it must perform is proportional to the number of bits in the exponent $O(\\log E)$. The exponent $E$ is the product of all odd prime powers less than $B$, so $\\log E$ is the sum of the logarithms of these prime powers. The prime number theorem shows that $O(\\log E) = O(B)$.\n","\n","Combining these, the total time for this main step is $O(B \\log^2 N)$.\n","\n","*   If we choose a small $B$, the exponentiation step is fast. However, the chance that the class number $h(d)$ is $B$-smooth is low. This means we might have to try many values of $k$ or perform many squarings, making the algorithm run for a long time.\n","*   If we choose a large $B$, the chance of $h(d)$ being B-smooth is much higher, making the algorithm more likely to succeed quickly. However, the exponentiation step now becomes very slow.\n","\n","The optimal strategy is to choose a value for $B$ that balances these two competing factors. When this optimisation is done, the resulting complexity is sub-exponential. It is expressed using $L$-notation as\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    L_N[1/2, c] = \\exp(c \\sqrt{\\log N \\cdot \\log\\log N})\n","\\end{equation}\n","where $c$ is a small constant.\n","\n","*   Trial division has a complexity of $O(\\sqrt{N})$ which in L-notation is $L_N[1, 1/2]$, hence is exponential.\n","*   General number field sieve is the fastest known classical factoring algorithm with complexity is $L_N[1/3, c]$. It is asymptotically faster than the class group method because the term in the exponent is $(\\log N)^{1/3}$ instead of $(\\log N)^{1/2}$.\n","*   Shor's algorithm in quantum computing has a complexity of $O(\\log^3 N)$ which is of polynomial time and is therefore theoretically much faster than any of the classical algorithms."],"metadata":{"id":"Rjd5-l1htmZc"}}]}
