A naive implementation would calculate the full polynomial which would have a degree of $(p-1)/2$, making it computationally infeasible for large $p$. We avoid this by using polynomial modular exponentiation. For polynomials $A(x)$ and $B(x)$, we have that $\\gcd(A(x), B(x)) = \\gcd(A(x), B(x) \\bmod A(x))$. This means we only need to compute $(x + v)^{(p-1)/2} \\mod f(x)$ which we do by repeated squaring.
