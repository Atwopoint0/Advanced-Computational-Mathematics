A higher $k$ creates a more complex tree that better approximates the continuous distribution of the underlying Brownian motion for the same number of time steps.\n","\n","The benefit of increasing $k$ is more pronounced for the American put option. The value of an American option is highly dependent on accurately defining the optimal exercise boundary. A larger $k1$ creates a much denser grid of possible prices at each time step which allows for a much more precise estimation of the exercise boundary's location, leading to a more accurate valuation of early exercise. The European option has no such feature, so while it also benefits from the better distributional approximation, the effect is less critical.\n","\n","We now analyse complexity. The outer loop runs $n$ times for each time step. The middle loop runs $O(ik)$ times, where $i$ goes up to $n$ which is $O(nk)$.\n","The innermost loop runs $k$ times. Combining these gives a rough time complexity of $O(n^2k^2)$ The complexity is quadratic in $n$ and $k$ which means that this is significantly more computationally expensive than the $k=1$ Bernoulli approximation, but it can achieve higher accuracy for a smaller $n$."],"metadata":{"id":"pYiXP-Rh9lmV"}}]}
