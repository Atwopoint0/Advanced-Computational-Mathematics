Proteins are often composed of combinations of different domains from a relatively small repertoire; so two protein sequences might be relatively similar over several regions, but differ in other regions where one protein contains a certain domain but the other does not.\n","\n","At some computational cost, we can still align two protein strings taking gaps into account. Let $w(l) < 0$, for $l > 1$, be the score of deleting (or inserting) a sequence of amino acids of length $l$ from or into a protein. Let $v_{\\text{gap}}(S, T)$ be the gap-weighted score between $S$ and $T$, and write\n","$V_{\\text{gap}}(i, j)$ for $v_{\\text{gap}}(S[1, i], T[1, j])$. Then\n","\\begin{align}\n","    V_{\\text{gap}}(i, j) = \\max \\{E(i, j), F(i, j), G(i, j)\\}, \\\\\n","    E(i, j) = \\max_{0 \\leq k \\leq j-1} \\{V_{\\text{gap}}(i, k) + w(j -k)\\}, \\\\\n","    F(i, j) = \\max_{0 \\leq k \\leq i-1} \\{V_{\\text{gap}}(k, j) + w(i - k)\\}, \\\\\n","    G(i, j) = V_{\\text{gap}}(i - 1, j - 1) + s(S_i, T_j).\n","\\end{align}\n","Iterating the above equations on the $n$ by $m$ grid has complexity of $O(mn^2 + nm^2)$.\n","\n","Fortunately, if $w(l)$ takes some fixed value $u$ for all $l > 1$, then there exists an algorithm for finding $v_{\\text{gap}}$ which has complexity $O(mn)$. Indeed, calculating the cost of a gap does not depend on the length of the gap, but simply on the existence of a gap. Substituting the fixed constant $w(l) = u$, we obtain\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    E(i, j) = u + \\max_{0 \\leq k \\leq j-1} V_{\\text{gap}}(i, k).\n","\\end{equation}\n","This tells us that the score for an Insertion at $(i, j)$ is simply the maximum score seen so far in the current row $i$ plus the constant $u$. Similarly, the score for a Deletion is the maximum score seen so far in the current column $j$ plus $u$. Instead of iterating backwards through $k$ for every cell, we can maintain the row and column maximums and update these values incrementally. Thus, the time complexity is $O(mn)$ as we traverse the grid exactly once, performing a constant number of operations and the space complexity is also $O(mn)$, we as need to store the scores.\n","\n","For a fixed gap penalty $u < 0$, the boundary conditions are similar to before $V(0, 0) = 0$, $V(i, 0) = u$ and $V(0, j) = u$.

Choose $K$ large enough such that $-K < 2u$ so that $S_{\\text{diag}} = -K$ is a possible event, specifically, when $U_i \\neq V_i$ for all $i$. The probability of a mismatch at one position is $2pq = 1/2$ so the probability of $K$ mismatches is $1/2^K > 0$. Hence $\\Pr(S_{\\text{diag}} < 2u) > 0$ as required."],"metadata":{"id":"Px1tKN6NFOVk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import random\n","import time\n","\n","def calculate_gap_score(s1, s2, u):\n","    '''\n","    Calculates the optimal gap-weighted score between two strings\n","    using a fixed gap penalty u.\n","    '''\n","    m = len(s1)\n","    n = len(s2)\n","\n","    # We only need two rows to calculate the score plus the column max trackers.\n","    # Initialise previous row\n","    # V[0][j] = u (for j > 0), 0 for j=0\n","    prev_row = [u] * (n + 1)\n","    prev_row[0] = 0\n","\n","    # Initialise column max trackers\n","    # col_max[j] stores max(V[0...i-1][j])\n","    col_max = list(prev_row)\n","\n","    current_row = [0] * (n + 1)\n","\n","    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n","        # Initialise row max tracker\n","        # row_max stores max(V[i][0...j-1])\n","        current_row[0] = u\n","        row_max = u\n","\n","        char1 = s1[i-1]\n","\n","        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n","            char2 = s2[j-1]\n","\n","            # Match/Mismatch (s(a,a)=1, s(a,b)=-1)\n","            score_char = 1 if char1 == char2 else -1\n","            score_diag = prev_row[j-1] + score_char\n","\n","            # Insertion (Horizontal gap)\n","            # max(V[i][k]) + u  => row_max + u\n","            score_ins = row_max + u\n","\n","            # Deletion (Vertical gap)\n","            # max(V[k][j]) + u => col_max[j] + u\n","            score_del = col_max[j] + u\n","\n","            # Maximise\n","            val = max(score_diag, score_ins, score_del)\n","            current_row[j] = val\n","\n","            # Update running maximums\n","            if val > row_max:\n","                row_max = val\n","            if val > col_max[j]:\n","                col_max[j] = val\n","\n","        # Move current row to previous for next iteration\n","        prev_row = list(current_row)\n","\n","    return current_row[n]\n","\n","def run_simulation():\n","    '''\n","    Monte Carlo simulation.\n","    '''\n","    # Parameters\n","    u = -3\n","    # Lengths n to test\n","    n_values = [50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000]\n","\n","    print(f\"{'n':<10} | {'Trials':<10} | {'Avg Score':<12} | {'Estimate (Score/n)':<20}\")\n","    print(\"-\" * 60)\n","\n","    results = []\n","\n","    for n in n_values:\n","        # As n increases, the variance decreases so we can reduce the trials\n","        trials = 100 if n < 1000 else 20\n","\n","        total_score = 0\n","\n","        for _ in range(trials):\n","            # Generate random strings (p=0.5 for 'a' and 'b')\n","            s1 = \"\".join(random.choices(['a', 'b'], k=n))\n","            s2 = \"\".join(random.choices(['a', 'b'], k=n))\n","\n","            score = calculate_gap_score(s1, s2, u)\n","            total_score += score\n","\n","        avg_score = total_score / trials\n","        estimate = avg_score / n\n","        results.append(estimate)\n","\n","        print(f\"{n:<10} | {trials:<10} | {avg_score:<12.2f} | {estimate:<20.5f}\")\n","\n","    print(\"-\" * 60)\n","    print(f\"Estimated Limit: {results[-1]:.5f}\")\n","\n","run_simulation()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4LlOOq77RqaT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1766528587307,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":56655,"user":{"displayName":"Alex Zhou","userId":"15814347624889041767"}},"outputId":"68329c0d-c34b-4679-b263-8bf1eff9161b"},"execution_count":45,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["n          | Trials     | Avg Score    | Estimate (Score/n)  \n","------------------------------------------------------------\n","50         | 100        | 16.01        | 0.32020             \n","100        | 100        | 36.79        | 0.36790             \n","200        | 100        | 80.16        | 0.40080             \n","500        | 100        | 210.24       | 0.42048             \n","1000       | 20         | 434.25       | 0.43425             \n","2000       | 20         | 869.80       | 0.43490             \n","------------------------------------------------------------\n","Estimated Limit: 0.43490\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To estimate the limit $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbb{E}[v_{\\text{gap}}(U^n, V^n)]$, we rely LLN and the Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem.
