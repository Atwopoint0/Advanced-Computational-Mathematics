Molecular sequence data is important because two proteins with similar sequences often have similar functions or structures. This means that we can learn about the function of a protein in humans by studying the functions of proteins with similar sequences in simpler organisms such as yeast, fruit flies, or frogs.\n","\n","We will examine methods for comparison of two sequences, working with two strings $S$ and $T$ of lengths $m$ and $n$ respectively, composed of characters\n","from some finite alphabet. Write $S_i$ for the $i$-th character of $S$, and $S[i, j]$ for the substring $S_i, \\dots, S_j$. If $i > j$ then $S[i, j]$ is the empty string. A prefix of $S$ is a substring $S[1, k]$ for some $k \\leq m$ (possibly the empty prefix). Similarly, a suffix of $S$ is a substring $S[k, m]$ with $k > 1$.\n","\n","Suppose $S = \\textit{fruit}$ and $T = \\textit{berry}$. We can transform $S$ into $T$ by\n","1.  Replacing $f$ with $b$,\n","2.  Inserting $e$,\n","3.  Matching $r$ with $r$,\n","4.  Replacing $u$ with $r$,\n","5.  Replacing $i$ with $y$,\n","6.  Deleting $t$.\n","\n","We call $\\text{RIMRRD}$ the editing transcript. The alignment of $S$ and $T$ is read vertically character by character.\n","\n","There are many possible ways to transform one string into another; but from an\n","evolutionary point of view there must be a cost associated with any action other than matching. The optimal edit transcripts are those that involve the least number of edit operations (Replace, Insert, and Delete). We define the edit distance $d(S, T)$ to be the minimal number of edits between $S$ and $T$. Let $D(i, j) = d(S[1, i], T[1, j])$. Observe that $d(S, T) = D(m, n)$.\n","\n","\n","To find the optimal edit distance $D(i, j)$ between the prefix $S[1, i]$ and $T[1, j]$, we consider the last operation performed to achieve the alignment. There are only three possible ways the alignment can end at indices $i$ and $j$:\n","\n","1.  Deletion (aligning $S_i$ with a gap)\n","\n","    We assume that $S_i$ is deleted. This means we must have already transformed the prefix $S[1, i-1]$ into $T[1, j]$. The total cost is equal to the cost of the sub-problem $D(i-1, j)$ plus the cost of one deletion $D(i-1, j) + 1$.\n","\n","2.  Insertion (aligning a gap with $T_j$)\n","\n","    We assume that $T_j$ is inserted. This means we must have already transformed the full prefix $S[1, i]$ into the prefix $T[1, j-1]$. Here, the total cost is equal to the cost of the sub-problem $D(i, j-1)$ plus the cost of one insertion $D(i, j-1) + 1$.\n","\n","3. Match or Replacement (aligning $S_i$ with $T_j$)\n","\n","    We assume that $S_i$ and $T_j$ are aligned together. This means we must have transformed $S[1, i-1]$ into $T[1, j-1]$. The total cost is equal to the cost of the sub-problem $D(i-1, j-1)$ plus the cost of the action on the current characters which is $0$ for a match and $1$ for a replacement. This is $D(i-1, j-1) + s(S_i, T_j)$ where\n","\n","    \\begin{equation}\n","        s(a, b) =\n","        \\begin{cases}\n","        0 & a = b, \\\\\n","        1 & a \\neq b.\n","        \\end{cases}\n","    \\end{equation}\n","\n","Since $D(i, j)$ is defined as the minimal number of edits, it must be the minimum of these three possible scenarios. Thus,\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    D(i, j) = \\min \\{ D(i-1, j) + 1, \\ D(i, j-1) + 1, \\ D(i-1, j-1) + s(S_i, T_j) \\}.\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","To solve the recurrence, we need base cases for when one or both strings are empty. These are given by\n","\\begin{align}\n","    D(0, 0) = 0, \\quad D(i, 0) = i, \\quad D(0, j) = j.\n","\\end{align}\n","The first comes from the fact that the edit distance between two empty strings is $0$. In the second case, transforming a string of length $i$ into an empty string requires deleting all $i$ characters.
