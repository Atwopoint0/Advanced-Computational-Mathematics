For example, the full sequences of the oxygen-binding proteins myoglobin and haemoglobin are very similar. Often, though, only a small region of the protein is critical to its function and only this region will be conserved throughout the evolutionary process. When we identify two proteins which perform similar functions but look superficially different, it is useful to identify these highly conserved regions.\n","\n","We aim to find a pair of substrings $S'$ and $T'$ of $S$ and $T$ respectively with the highest alignment score, namely,\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    v_{\\text{sub}}(S, T) = \\max\\{v(S', T') : S' \\text{ is a substring of } S,\\, T' \\text{ is a substring of } T\\}.\n","\\end{equation}\n","We write $s(-, a) = s(a, -) < 0$ for the score of an insertion or deletion.\n","\n","Finding $v_{\\text{sub}}(S, T)$ seems to be of much higher complexity than solving the global alignment problem, as there are $\\Theta(n^2m^2)$ combinations of substrings of $S$ and $T$.
