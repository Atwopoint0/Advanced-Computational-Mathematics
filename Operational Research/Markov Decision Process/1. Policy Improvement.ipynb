Every day, the operating cost for their car increases, as does the probability that the car breaks down. Even worse, when trading in the car for a different one dealers will pay less for older cars and charge more for newer ones. The problem, then, is to find an optimal policy for trading in the car.\n","\n","We model the problem as a Markov decision process. Let $g_j(u)$ be the instantaneous cost incurred if one takes action $u$ in state $j$ and let $p_{jk}(u)$ be the probability of then moving to state $k$.

The first equation is the policy evaluation step where the average cost $\\gamma^{(n)}$ of the current policy is calculated, and the second equation is the policy improvement step.\n","\n","Note that the values $f_j^{(n)}$ are arbitrary up to an additive constant and can be normalised, for example by letting $f_1^{(n)} = 0$.

The sequence $\\gamma^{(n)}$ is non-increasing, and will converge to a minimum value $\\gamma$ in a finite number of steps if $u$ can take\n","only a finite number of values.
