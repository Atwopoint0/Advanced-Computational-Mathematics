This counter-intuitive scenario arises when the trade-in value $T_j$ is not linear, but rather undergoes a sharp drop between age $n$ and $n+1$, and then stabilises.\n","\n","The decision to replace a car is essentially a comparison between the marginal cost of keeping, i.e., the operating costs for the next year plus the depreciation over the next year, versus, the average cost of a new car, i.e. the long-run average cost of starting over with a new vehicle.\n","\n","If the trade-in value drops largely between year $n$ and $n+1$, then the marginal cost of keeping at age $n$ is extremely high and dominated by the loss in resale value. This forces a replace decision. However, once we reach age $n+1$, that massive depreciation has already occurred. It is now a sunk cost. If the depreciation between $n+1$ and $n+2$ is small, then the marginal cost of keeping for the next year might be lower than the average cost of a new car. This forces a keep decision.\n","\n","There is even an example where the purchase price, trade-in price, operating cost, and survival probability are all monotone. Consider the deterministic example (survival probability $=1$) with the new car price equal to $6000$ and for a standard replacement cycle, the average cost is $1200$ per year. For $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, let $(O_j)_j = (0, 200, 400, 600)$ and $(T_j)_{j} = (500, 4000, 100, 100)$. Then the depreciation in the next year is $(D_j)_j = (T_j - T_{j+1})_j$ and the marginal cost to keep is $O_j + D_j$.\n","\n","1.

At age $2$:\n","    *   If we keep until age $3$, then we pay $400$ in operating costs. The car only loses $100$ in value.
