We aim to calculate the size of the ionised region, and gain some insight into how its structure depends on the nature of the radiation from the star.\n","\n","Assuming that there is a uniform, static, constant temperature gas surrounding a spherically symmetric star provides a good approximation. Each gas element is assumed to be in ionisation equilibrium, so the ionisation rate for each atom is balanced by recombinations. We assume that the sole source of ionisation is by absorption of radiation from the star giving a bound electron enough energy to escape from the atom. Recombination occurs when a free electron is captured by an ion with the creation of a photon. Since hydrogen is the most common element in the Universe, its behaviour will dominate in most cases, so we consider only a pure hydrogen interstellar medium.\n","\n","The radiation from the star is specified as $L_\\nu$, the total energy output from the star per unit frequency $\\nu$ per unit time, so the luminosity per unit frequency interval $L_\\nu$ is expressed in $\\mathrm{W Hz}^{-1}$.
