We will now investigate which of the minimal DFAs computed in previous questions define finite languages. Let $D$ be a DFA with $n$ states. We claim that $\\mathcal{L}D$ is infinite if and only if $\\mathcal{L}(D)$ contains a word $w$ of length $n \\leq |w| \\leq 2n-1$.\n","\n","Assume that such a word exists. Since $|w| \\geq n$, the path taken by the automaton to process $w$ involves $|w| + 1 \\geq n + 1$ states visited in the sequence. By the pigeonhole principle, since there are only $n$ distinct states in the DFA, at least one state must be visited twice. This implies that the path contains a cycle. We can decompose $w$ into three parts $w = xyz$, where:\n","\n","*   $x$ is the path from the start to the first occurrence of the repeated state.\n","*   $y \\geq 1$ is the path around the cycle returning to the same state.\n","*   $z$ is the path from the repeated state to an accepting state.\n","\n","Since the cycle brings the automaton back to the same state, we can traverse the cycle loop any number of times. Thus, the words $xy^iz$ for all $i \\geq 0$ are also accepted by $D$. Since $|y| \\geq 1$, each word in the sequence $xy^0z, xy^1z, xy^2z, \\dots$ has a strictly increasing length. Therefore, $\\mathcal{L}(D)$ contains infinitely many distinct words.\n","\n","Conversely, assume that $\\mathcal{L}(D)$ is infinite. It cannot contain only words of length less than $n$, thus, $\\mathcal{L}(D)$ must contain at least one word with length $\\geq n$. Let $w$ be the shortest such word. We claim that $|w| \\leq 2n - 1$.\n","\n","Assume otherwise $|w| \\geq 2n$. Since $|w| \\ge n$, by the pumping lemma, we can write $w = xyz$ where $1 \\leq |y| \\leq n$, with $xz$ in $\\mathcal{L}(D)$. Then\n","$|xz| = |w| - |y|$ so we have $|w| - n \\leq |xz| < |w|$. Using our assumption, we have $|xz| \\ge 2n - n = n$. So $xz$ is a word in $\\mathcal{L}(D)$ with length $\\geq n$ that is strictly shorter than $w$, giving a contradiction. Hence, the shortest word satisfying the length condition must lie in the range $n \\leq |w| \\le 2n - 1$."],"metadata":{"id":"NHm_U7FWYHJJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# @title Data\n","\n","Table_1 = \"\"\"\n","2  5  1\n","10 10 1\n","1  2  0\n","8  3  0\n","9  2  0\n","9  2  0\n","1  9  1\n","4  6  0\n","3  6  0\n","9  2  1\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","Table_2 = \"\"\"\n","6 4 7 1\n","3 6 5 0\n","2 6 2 0\n","6 2 2 0\n","7 7 3 0\n","3 7 6 0\n","5 4 6 0\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","Table_3 = \"\"\"\n","9 5 5 1\n","7 2 6 0\n","7 4 1 0\n","1 2 8 0\n","8 1 6 0\n","9 9 8 0\n","9 3 4 0\n","8 3 5 0\n","8 3 1 0\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","Table_4 = \"\"\"\n","18  65  1\n","67  33  1\n","34  66  1\n","90  75  1\n","12  59  1\n","99  75  1\n","54  24  1\n","71  74  1\n","100 98  1\n","29  87  1\n","42  9   1\n","47  37  1\n","77  37  1\n","82  69  1\n","11  60  1\n","18  79  1\n","36  37  1\n","6   21  1\n","53  9   1\n","34  78  1\n","18  21  1\n","21  39  1\n","91  56  1\n","68  23  1\n","47  65  1\n","92  49  1\n","11  16  1\n","75  79  1\n","74  11  1\n","57  30  1\n","19  24  1\n","60  54  1\n","30  10  1\n","14  41  1\n","22  11  1\n","90  12  1\n","8   79  1\n","25  30  1\n","6   61  1\n","45  97  1\n","2   44  1\n","90  70  1\n","20  76  1\n","10  44  1\n","31  66  1\n","46  11  1\n","11  94  1\n","100 19  1\n","34  27  1\n","30  80  1\n","7   49  1\n","30  77  1\n","5   40  1\n","51  28  1\n","77  4   1\n","64  68  1\n","9   43  1\n","9   46  1\n","78  61  1\n","91  6   1\n","54  32  1\n","11  78  1\n","83  70  1\n","34  13  1\n","30  14  1\n","75  10  1\n","2   1   1\n","5   43  1\n","67  66  1\n","61  73  1\n","53  54  1\n","73  11  1\n","71  64  1\n","79  13  1\n","29  14  1\n","70  10  1\n","56  15  1\n","40  17  1\n","7   20  1\n","79  32  1\n","34  32  1\n","61  22  1\n","75  26  1\n","11  90  1\n","13  71  1\n","55  56  1\n","49  19  1\n","90  22  1\n","80  8   1\n","74  92  1\n","6   71  1\n","8   56  1\n","9   32  1\n","80  17  1\n","95  63  1\n","69  99  1\n","14  18  1\n","73  26  1\n","12  40  1\n","12  8   1\n","\"\"\""],"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"q1NPNDgZozvb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1766934867732,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Alex Zhou","userId":"15814347624889041767"}}},"execution_count":38,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","def parse_table(table_str):\n","    '''\n","    Parses a space-delimited string into a 2D integer list (matrix).\n","    Handles multi-line strings with potential extra whitespace.\n","    '''\n","    # Filter out empty lines to avoid parsing errors\n","    lines = [line for line in table_str.strip().splitlines() if line.strip()]\n","    return np.loadtxt(lines, dtype=int)\n","\n","def get_accessible_states(transition_table):\n","    '''\n","    Determines the set of accessible states.\n","    '''\n","    # Handle empty case\n","    if transition_table.size == 0:\n","        return []\n","\n","    n_states, cols = transition_table.shape\n","    k = cols -
