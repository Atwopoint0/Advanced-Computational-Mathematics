Such machines are very limited in the things they can compute. However, the tasks they do compute are performed extremely fast, like integer reductions modulo $m$.\n","\n","Associated to each DFA is a unique minimal state DFA; the unique one (up to renumbering of states) which accepts the same language and has the smallest possible number of states. Thus, every regular language can be represented by a unique minimal state DFA. From hereon, an $(n, k)$-DFA is one with $n$ states and an alphabet of size $k$.\n","\n","There are many well-known algorithms that, on input of any DFA, produce the minimal DFA associated to it. We shall use Hopcroft's table-filling algorithm. We aim to count all the minimal $(n, k)$-DFAs for sufficiently small $(n, k)$, and we investigate which of these define finite languages.\n","\n","There are many symmetry properties of DFAs we can appeal to that may make our programs run faster and more efficiently (and in some cases, more elegant and concise). Moreover, we can verify some of the small cases by hand, which can be useful to check that our programs are running correctly.\n","\n","---\n","\n","Without loss of generality, we will assume that our states are always labelled by integers, and that any DFA with $n$ states has these labelled by $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. We will also always assume that the state labelled $1$ is the start state. Finally, we will assume that any DFA on $k$ letters has alphabet $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n","\n","An $(n, k)$-transition table is a transition table for an $(n, k)$-DFA. We will need to establish a way to store transition tables. As we have adopted the convention that state $1$ is the start state, this does not need to be reflected in the table. One way to store such tables could be as a matrix. We can use an $n \\times (k + 1)$ matrix to represent an $(n, k)$-transition table, with the final column consisting of $1$'s and $0$'s to denote which states are accepting or non-accepting.
