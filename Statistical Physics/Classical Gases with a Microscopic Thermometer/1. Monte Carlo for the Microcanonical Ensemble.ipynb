This is an example of a Monte Carlo algorithm. It operates as follows:\n","\n","1.  As an initial configuration, set $p_i = e_1$ for all $i$, where $e_1$ is a unit vector in the $x$-direction. Initialise also $E_d = 0$.\n","\n","2.  Choose one of the $N$ particles at random and compute its current energy $E_{\\text{curr}}$. Generate a random vector $\\Delta p$ and propose a change of the particle's momentum, from $p_i$ to $p_i + \\Delta p$. A good choice is to take each component of the vector $\\Delta p$ to be a random number from $(−\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ with $\\epsilon = 0.1$. Compute the energy that the particle would have if its momentum was $p_i + \\Delta p$: this is the proposed energy $E_{\\text{prop}}$.\n","\n","3.  Define $\\Delta E \\equiv E_{\\text{prop}} - E_{\\text{curr}}$. If $\\Delta E \\leq E_d$ then accept the change. That is, update the momentum of particle $i$ to a new value $p_i + \\Delta p$, and update $E_d$ to a new value $E_d - \\Delta E$. If $\\Delta E > E_d$ then the change is rejected and no variables are updated.\n","\n","4.  Whether or not the change was accepted, record the value of $E_d$ as a new value in an array (or list) which will later be used to plot a histogram. Also record the energy of the particle. (This is called the single-particle energy.) If the change was accepted, we record these values after the update was performed.\n","\n","5.  Repeat steps 2-4 until the total number of attempted updates is $N_{\\text{updates}}$.
