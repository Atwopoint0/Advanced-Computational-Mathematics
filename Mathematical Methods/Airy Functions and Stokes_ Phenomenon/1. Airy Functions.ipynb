Also, they may also depend on which region of the complex plane is under consideration. This is known as Stokes' phenomenon, and the rays from the origin that divide the complex plane into different regions are known as Stokes lines. In the current case, there are three Stokes lines, two of which are given by the rays $\\arg{z} = \\pm\\pi/3$.\n","\n","In this project, we shall concentrate to start with on the region $R$ given by $|\\arg{z}| < \\pi/3$.
